### About Me

I’m a recent graduate with a B.S. in Data Science from UNC Charlotte, driven by a strong interest in turning data into clear, actionable insights. I'm actively building my skills through hands-on projects focused on real-world problems, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

I have experience using Python, SQL, and Excel to explore data, uncover patterns, and build predictive models. My recent work includes personal projects that showcase my ability to automate tasks, analyze trends, and present findings in a clear, impactful way.

### Projects

#### Immigrant Integration Trends Analysis  
*Python, scikit-learn, PCA, Clustering*  

- Analyzed 10+ years of ACS data, uncovering population growth (750K → 1.15M) and degree attainment rise (18% → 23%).  
- Applied PCA and clustering to identify three distinct phases of integration: pre-pandemic, pandemic disruption, and post-pandemic cohesion.  
- Validated clustering quality (silhouette score: 0.63), confirming distinct assimilation phases.  
- Delivered insights through visualizations and reports, highlighting immigrant educational attainment growth and post-COVID assimilation patterns.

#### Crime Prediction with Machine Learning  
*Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Data Visualization*  

- Processed data from 2,215 U.S. cities, reducing 147 features to 13 key socioeconomic variables.  
- Identified top predictors: unemployment (+0.29) and income (–0.45) as drivers of larceny rates.  
- Compared multiple models; Random Forest delivered 81.9% accuracy and reduced errors by 38% compared to CART.  
- Designed visual dashboards with feature-importance charts to inform policy-oriented stakeholder discussions.
